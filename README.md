## Overview
This set of `python` scripts implements one-dimensional exact factorization analysis using the reverse engineer approach to compute the nuclear phase, nuclear density, TDPES, and the residual of the continuity equation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\nabla_{z}.J_{z} %2B \partial_{t}\rho_{z} = f(z,t)">.
